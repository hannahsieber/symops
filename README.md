# symops

In order to run the subcommands, you must enter `python msr.py [subcommand and args]`
Please see https://symopsio.github.io/backend-challenge/ for details on subcommands.

Tasks not completed:
- Can not run as a simple CLI with msr (and using `pip install`)
- Because of this, cannot be tested with `test.sh`
- `measure` may not redirect as requested

Thank you for this opportunity!
